## CPU

A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the most important processor in a given computer.
Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry,[1] and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.
Principal components of a CPU include the arithmeticâ€“logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations,
processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and execution (of instructions) by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.

Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors. The individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to create additional virtual or logical CPUs.

An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).

Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered central. Virtual CPUs are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources.

## GPU

A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.

Modern GPUs are efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing.
Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard.
In some CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.

In the 1970s, the term "GPU" originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable processing unit independently working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and output.
Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing unit) in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as "the world's first GPU".
It was presented as a "single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines".
Rival ATI Technologies coined the term "visual processing unit" or VPU with the release of the Radeon 9700 in 2002.

## DPU

A data processing unit (DPU) is a channel controller, a programmable specialized electronic circuit with hardware acceleration of data processing for data-centric computing.
The data is transmitted to and from the component as multiplexed packets of information. A DPU generally contains a CPU, NIC and programmable data acceleration engines.
This allows DPUs to have the generality and the programmability of central processing units while being specialized to operate efficiently on networking packets, storage requests or analytics requests.

The data acceleration engines differentiates itself from a CPU by a larger degree of parallelism (required to process many requests) and from a GPU by a MIMD architecture rather than an SIMD architecture (required as each request needs to make different decisions and follow a different path through the chip).
DPUs can be either ASIC-based, FPGA-based or SoC-based.
DPUs have been increasingly used in data centers and supercomputers since their introduction in the 2010s due to the rise in use of data-centric computing, big data, security, and artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning.
DPUs are designed to be independent infrastructure endpoints
